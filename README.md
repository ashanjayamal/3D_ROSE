Mathematics isn't just about numbers; it's a profound way to explore and represent patterns that resonate with beauty. This project delves into blending mathematical equations with graphical representations to create two mesmerizing 3D visualizations using Python.

## Overview

This project focuses on generating stunning 3D shapes using a parametric equation and two different Python libraries:
1. **Matplotlib** for a static 3D plot with a "Reds" colormap.
2. **Plotly** for an interactive 3D surface with custom color scales.

The equation parameters allow for easy customization and exploration of unique shapes.
